Your MAIN TASK: Given the proxy-manager.py CLI tool create a complete re-implementation in Rust with an additional TUI.

There might have been some progress done already.
Try to keep the track of progress and todos in the PROGRESS.md file.
Check your branch first, evaluate the repository state, then continue on with the next most important unfinished todo.

When acting on the implementation step:
- Create unit tests for each new feature.
- Make sure the architecture is logical and clean.
- Commit each self-contained set of changes that you make.
- Before commit run 'cargo fmt'.
- Make sure there are no failing tests.
- Make sure there are no clippy warnings.
- Update PROGRESS.md file.

Once you're ready:
- Make sure the implementation is complete, clean, well-tested and ready for production release.
